Intended to give an overview of how our frontend stack fits together - and why we do things this way, covering the following topics:

[ ] HTML, CSS & JS - documents vs applications, DOM - how and why it's like this.
[ ] LESS vs CSS
[ ] Bootstrap & jQuery
[ ] Server side & Client side templating - tornado & handlebars.js
[ ] REST & stateless applications, client/server side state, cookies
